# Collectico Telegram BOT

## Contribution

This part is important for me so I put this in the beginning of documentation. For anyone interested in this project I will be more than happy to work you and expand this project specially on frontend.<br>

## Introduction

This is a Telegram bot for managing and tagging images files.
<br><br>
The photos you take during the day just to remember something can be tagged and later be available to access them using a website. Instead of forgetting the photos or misplace them, this bot will keep track of them as you tag them. Later on you can view the images with specific tags only by opening a tab in browser.
<br><br>
I'm still working on both frontend and backend to improve user experience and efficiency of data handling.

#### **Main usage**

Follow the steps below when you want to add new images.

1. send your images one by one. You can send them as photo or as file
1. After you sent all your files it's time to tag them. Send your tags separated with space or '#' at the beginning of new tag.

Some examples of valid tags:

- nature birds tall_tree tallTree

* #nature #birds #tall_tree #tallTree

- #nature#birds#lake#tall_tree #tallTree

You can separate tags with space or '#' and don't use dashes in your tagging(like: tall-tree is not a valid tagging)
